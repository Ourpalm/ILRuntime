Cecil
=====

Mono.Cecil is a library to generate and inspect programs and libraries in the ECMA CIL form.

To put it simply, you can use Cecil to:

* Analyze .NET binaries using a simple and powerful object model, without having to load assemblies to use Reflection.
* Modify .NET binaries, add new metadata structures and alter the IL code.

Cecil has been around since 2004 and is [widely used](https://github.com/jbevain/cecil/wiki/Users) in the .NET community.

Read about the Cecil development on the [development log](http://cecil.pe).

To discuss Cecil, the best place is the [mono-cecil](https://groups.google.com/group/mono-cecil) Google Group.

Cecil is a project under the benevolent umbrella of the [.NET Foundation](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/).
